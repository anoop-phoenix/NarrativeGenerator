# Narrative Generator

* Generate narrative (story) when executing a sequence of `predicate` statement. 
* If a predicate return `False`, the process will be terminated.
* The narrative can be represented as a string or a json like string.

## The sample problem

The process checks wether a student is a very good student or not. To be qualified for that hornor, the guy must have:
* All majors' overall are greater or equal 8.5
* With each major, there is no assignment's mark less than 5.0
* Certificate of IELTS

Beside the yes/no answer, the algorithm must provide the story evaluating the student.
