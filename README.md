# Story Generator
* Generate story (narrative) when executing a sequence of statement. 
* If there is a predicate and it returns `False`, the process will be terminated.
* The story can be represented as a paragraph with indent levels or a json like string. 

## The sample problem
### Sample 1 -> Evaluate() function
The process checks wether a student is a good student or not. To be qualified for that hornor, the guy must have:
* All majors' overall are greater or equal 8.5
* With each major, there is no assignment's mark less than 5.0
* Certificate of IELTS

If the student has the certificate of JLPT, he or she is qualified for a very good student hornor.

### Sample 2 -> Average() function
The process also return the overall score of the student. Show reference to overal score of each subject.

**Beside**, the algorithm must provide the story evaluating the student.

## Experience
* Only provide `ReferenceResource` in the leaf node, therefore, the information is not duplicated 
* The detail of `story` depends on the intent of the author

## Note
* Class `EvaluationProcesses` has its own print method `GenerateStory`. Sample [here](#Sample\ story\ generated\ by\ `EvaluationProcess`'s\ method).
* If yor want to print it like a like string, just use built-in golang library `fmt`

## Appendix
### Sample story generated by `EvaluationProcess`'s method
```
Every subject's assignments are over 5 and the average is $gte 8.5
<boolean: true>
	All items are over 5 and the average is $gte 8.5
	<boolean: true>
	All items are over 5 and the average is $gte 8.5
	<boolean: true>
The student has the IELTS certificate
<boolean: true>
The student has the JLPT certificate
<boolean: false>
```
